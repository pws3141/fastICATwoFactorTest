Here we compare the loading and score obtained using fastICA to the true loading and
score obtained by maximising a direct approximation to negentropy.

Motivation: 
Check whether fastICA always works on two-factor examples.
Split this into two tests: whether the fastICA objective function has the correct
global optima; and, whether the fastICA iterative optimisation correctly finds this
global maxima.
